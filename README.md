# ACM Warm Up Day Three

## Rule's of the Warm up
**Warm up's are closed notes, closed friend, and closed internet (unless a link is provided for you)**

**You may not use awesome packages (like Numpy or Scipy) in Warmups. (Use math: eg. "import math as m")**

**Please at very least attempt the warm-ups. They will be the medium for feedback in this Class**


#Coin Count
Your job is to simply fill in "pass" with the appropriate solution.
